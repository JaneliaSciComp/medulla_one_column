		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<div style="width:500px">
			<p align="left">Entries can end with * (asterisk) and matches any body name 
				with the given prefix.  Separate entries with commas.
				For example, "L1*, Mi1, T*" matches any prefix L1, the body Mi1, and
				any body prefixed with T.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Disclaimers</h3>
		<div style="width:500px">
			<ol align="left">
				<li>Within a central, reference medulla column, two proofreaders attempted to 
					assign each synaptic contact to its pre- and postsynaptic neurons. In approx. 
					50% of the cases, they were able to complete the assignment, achieving >90% 
					certainty for the assigned synapses. The 50% assignment rate implies that any 
					pair of neurons in the central column (detailed here) connected with >5 
					contacts is present with >95% probability and, similarly, any pair of neurons 
					in the central column that is unconnected has â‰¤ 5 synaptic contacts (again 
					with >95% probability).</li>
				<li>Outside of the central column, synaptic contacts between L1 and Tm3 neurons, 
					Tm3 and T4 neurons, and Mi1 and T4 neurons were traced by an expert 
					proofreader. Synaptic contacts between other neurons outside the reference 
					column were not uniformly traced.</li>
				<li>We reserve the right to update the number of synaptic contacts in the future.</li>
